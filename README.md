This repository contains all of the files that were needed to create my website. This contains all of the alignments, fasta files, and gene annotations needed. 
For some reason, however, it seems like GitHub pages wasn't able to process the compressed files for my alignments or my gene annotations.
Therefore, I opted for an external app to make my website, and this works perfectly, the link is below!

stalwart-zuccutto-e015a4.netlify.app

To navigate this app, first go to the website above, and then select "Linear Genome View". Then, you will have 15 different assemblies to choose from. 
The first 11 are the following species of poxviruses:

- Variola (NC_001611.1)
- Monkeypox (ON563414.3)
- Vaccinia (NC_006998.1)
- Cowpox (NC_003663.2)
- Orf Virus (NC_005336.1)
- Pseudocowpox Virus (pcpv) (NC_013804.1)
- Bovine Stomatitis Virus (bsv) (NC_005337.1)
- Ta na pox virus (TANV) (EF420156.1)
- Yaba-like disease virus (AJ293568.1)
- Ya ba monkey tumor virus (YMTV) (NC_005179.1)
- Molluscum Contagiosum virus (MCV) (MN931752.1)

For each of these, there will be a reference genome track and a gene annotations track for you to look. 
You can see these by opening track list. 

I've included all the other names I've called them in the jbrowse app so that you can keep track of them. 
The IDs, which are the long strings of letters and numbers, will be useful in the next 4 assemblies, outlined below.

- All Poxvirus species "poxes"

This assembly contains all of the species that we are exploring, and they are separated sequence name, which are the IDs above. In this assembly, 
there is a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) track, which has all 11 of these genomes aligned to each other. You can see the alignment for each respective sequence based on the sequence name selected,
and you can also turn on the gene annotations for that specific sequence name to observe the genes in conserved and unconserved regions based on the alignment.

- Orththopoxviruses "orthopoxviruses"

This assembly looks only at the orthopoxviruses, which are the variola, monkeypox, vaccinia, and cowpox viruses. Similar to before, there is an MSA track aligned to just these 4, and 
you can look at the gene annotations according to whichever sequence name you're on. 

- Parapoxviruses "parapoxviruses"

This assembly looks only at the parapoxviruses, which are the pseudocowpox virus, orf virus, and the bovine papular stomatitis virus. Similar to before, there is an MSA track aligned to just these 3, and 
you can look at the gene annotations according to whichever sequence name you're on. 

-Yatapoxviruses "Yatapoxviruses"

This assembly looks only at the yatapoxviruses, which are the Ta na pox virus, Yaba-like disease virus, and the Yaba monkey tumor virus. Similar to before, there is an MSA track aligned to just these 3, and 
you can look at the gene annotations according to whichever sequence name you're on. 

If you're ever confused on which genome you're looking at, don't forget to refer to the list above, and you should be good to go!
